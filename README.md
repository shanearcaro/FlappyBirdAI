# FlappyBirdAI

## Implementation

This program is split into two different parts:

### Playable Game

A playable Flappy Bird Game that records the user's highscore for future games. This part of the program was used in a tournmanet where the highest scoring player would win a prize.

### Artificial Intelligence

A combination of a Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network to create a Flappy Bird AI that adapts to different parameters in its environment to achieve its goal of surviving as long as possible. The following environmental parameters can be altered: `delay`, `pipe gap`, `generation size`, `mutation percentage`, `crossover percentage`, and `pipe frequency`.

## Important Note

This program was written over three years when I was a Junior in High school. I no longer program in Java too often, and I have changed my programming style since. The project was recently recorved from a compiled state and was decompiled into its corresponding `.java` files. The first pass of decompilation yieled multiple errors while the second pass was more accurate. I have no way of knowing whether or not this was the original code. I will not be modifying any of the code here, it is as shown.
